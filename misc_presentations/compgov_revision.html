</section>
<section id="what-kkv-actually-claim" class="slide level2">
<h2>What KKV Actually Claim</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Both quantitative and qualitative research can be judged by the same criteria because they have a <em>common logic of inference</em>.
<ul>
<li class="fragment">These criteria or more explicitly stated/formulated in quantitative approaches.</li>
</ul></li>
<li class="fragment">All scientific research seeks to make inferences.
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Pure description is useful, but not scientific.</li>
<li class="fragment">Descriptive inference is good, but the goal is causal inference.</li>
</ul></li>
<li class="fragment">Theories must be falsifiable, and should maximise leverage.
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Parsimony is not a must.</li>
<li class="fragment">Not a <em>great</em> deal is said on theory generation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li class="fragment">Goal is <em>unbiased</em> inference: correct on average.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>There’s a lot to unpack here.</p>
<ul>
<li>This first point is my nuanced take on KKV. I don’t agree with a lot of the criticisms of KKV taking them to task for things they really don’t claim.</li>
<li>This is not to say I agree with all of their claims. I’m agnostic about a lot of these points.</li>
<li>On theories; KKV are a bit inconsistent on the extent to which theory generation is within the scope of their recommendations. They discuss it much less than theory <em>testing</em>, however.</li>
<li>Unbiased inference. This is a really critical point that we’ll come back to. (Rungs of causality).</li>

<h2>Rethinking Social Inquiry (RSI)</h2>
<p>The three highlighted chapters present distinct takes on the debate:</p>

<li class="fragment">Chapter 5: Rogowski</li>
<li class="fragment">Chapter 9: McKeown</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="rsi-1-omissions-in-the-debate" class="slide level2">
<h2>RSI 1: Omissions in the Debate</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><em>Not a refutation of KKV</em>. Authors agree that:
<ul>
<li class="fragment">common framework and vocabulary are important.</li>
<li class="fragment">both are founded on essentially similar epistemologies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li class="fragment"><em>Things KKV over-emphasizes</em>:
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Increasing N</strong> is not always helpful</li>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Deductive approaches</strong> at the cost of inductive approaches.</li>
</ul></li>
<li class="fragment"><em>Things KKV under-emphasizes</em>:
<ul>
<li class="fragment">The authors <strong>distinguish between the quantitative approach and the statistical/experimental approach</strong>.</li>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Conceptualization</strong> and <strong>measurement</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li class="fragment"><em>Overlooked contributions of qualitative methodology</em>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Knowledge of cases and contexts contributes to achieving valid inference.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>You don’t need to refute KKV to disagree. Given that the authors accept the basic goal and premise of KKV, their discussion of its omissions and their departures makes more sense.</li>
<li>What’s the problem with increasing N?</li>
<li>Deductive approach: KKV are especially keen to warn against post-hoc theorising. Authors claim this is overly puritan and ignores the contribution of inductive (e.g. Bayesian) approaches. Goal should be creating a guide to and systematising inductive procedures, not discouraging them.</li>
<li>Admittedly I’m not entirely whether this distinction is the same as the one I am thinking of. But this can certainly be tied to a later turn in the literature towards better foundations of quantitative causal inference. (See e.g. Imbens and Rubin 2015)</li>
<li>Conceptualization (e.g. Goertz) and measurement are important and overlooked agendas. Example of measuring polarization in parliaments: it’s a vague concept and measurements of it correspondingly suffer.</li>
<li>Contextual knowledge informs the plausibility/content of <em>ceteris paribus</em> assumptions, and provides a basis for judging measurement validity.</li>

<section id="rsi-5-kkv-on-rogowski-on-kkv" class="slide level2">
<h2>RSI 5: (KKV on) Rogowski on KKV</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><em>Use of Anomalous Cases</em>:
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Single anomalous observation is sufficient to disprove a theory.</li>
<li class="fragment">Lijphart (1968) uses the Netherlands to discredit a theory linking cross-cutting cleavages with social peace.</li>
<li class="fragment">Rogowski says this would be inadmissible for KKV as single observation.</li>
<li class="fragment">KKV reply that Lijphart positions his observation in a wider literature; not a single observation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li class="fragment"><em>Historical Accounts</em>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Rich description, no inference.</li>
<li class="fragment">KKV say this is useful, but political science must strive further (inference).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Rogowski’s critical response focuses on the importance of theory-building and the use of anomalous cases. KKV respond in a later chapter. This debate illuminates some nuances in KKV.</p>

<section id="rsi-5-cont." class="slide level2">
<h2>RSI 5: cont.</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><em>Selection on DV</em>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Katzenstein (1985) looks only at small European states; Rogowski points out that this fails to vary the DV (economic success).</li>
<li class="fragment">KKV point out that Katzenstein eschews causal claims (but retains ambiguously causal language).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Rogowski eventually summarizes and concludes on these points.</p>
<ul>
<li>Progress is possible without adhering to KKV’s paradigm:
<ul>
<li>A single aberrant case can disprove a strong deductive theory (e.g. Lijphart).</li>
<li>A powerful theory explaining a mysterious empirical regularity can gain “provisional acceptance” as “plausible conjecture”.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A proposed explanation is accepted if it (1) fits the data and (2) makes sense. KKV emphasise the former at the expense of the latter. This leads to recommending area specialists to focus on increasing N instead of developing better theory.</li>

<section id="rsi-9-epistemological-challenges" class="slide level2">
<h2>RSI 9: Epistemological Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">McKeown questions whether there is a common logic of inference at all.</li>
<li class="fragment">KKV essentially espouse a logical positivist epistemology based on Poppler and Hempel.</li>
<li class="fragment">Problematic to apply these ideas to research based on one or few cases:</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Lawyers tend to conduct causal inference from a single observation.</li>
<li>Relevant strand of literature: causal inference in the natural sciences is dominated by a perspective by Pearl. He introduces a “ladder of causality”, where the third and final rung is “but-for” counterfactual analyses. (Association, intervention and counterfactuals)</li>
<li>Think back to <em>unbiased</em> inference. The approach espoused by KKV is silent on individual-level counterfactuals; instead they seek to make unbiased estimates of <em>average</em> effects.</li>
</ul>

<section id="tripartite-consensus" class="slide level2">
<h2>Tripartite Consensus?</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">This consensus, laid out in Laitin (2002), consist of three prongs:
<ol type="1">
<li class="fragment">Large-N Statistical Analysis: not only for theory-testing, but for comparing the explanatory of competing explanations</li>
<li class="fragment">Theorization: comparative scholars now engage in a continuous and simultaneous process of theory testing and building.
<ol type="a">
<li class="fragment">Relatedly, formalization plays an important role in endogenizing the core variables of an analysis.</li>
</ol></li>
<li class="fragment">Case Study: to examine whether theories apply to real cases, and to build narative (e.g. by juxtaposing historical cases)</li>
</ol></li>
