    "This week in particular does not have correct \"solutions\". However, I encourage you to attempt the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make your figures as complete and professional as possible. This means adding titles, legends, axis labels, and making them aesthetically pleasing.\n",
    "- Write the solutions as generalisable functions. As much as possible you should be able to substitute the inputs and still get a complete and correctly-labelled figure.\n",

    "\n",
    "- First, create a color palette with a number of colors equal to the number of categories in your column. To do this, you will need the `sns.color_palette()`, `pd.Series.unique()`, and `dict(zip())`.\n",
    "    - Given two lists, `zip` will combine them into a list of pairs. e.g. `zip([1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c'])` will return `[(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]`. Passing this to `dict`, i.e. `dict(zip([1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']))`, will return `{1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c'}`.\n",
    "- Apply the dictionary to your column. You should get back a column of RGB values (a triplet of red, green and blue defining a color)."
