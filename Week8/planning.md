_Introduction to Natural Language Processing_

## _Week 8_: Introduction to Natural Language Processing

1. What is NLP?
2. Syntactic Parsing with `spaCy`
3. Entity recognition and document similarity with `spacy`

Students will be introduced to an advanced and increasingly popular natural language processing library: `spaCy`, and discuss how it can be useful in their own research. Students will learn basic concepts in natural language processing, and the challenges of operationalising text. References for more advanced models will also be included in the readings.

## Points to Cover

- What is natural language processing?
    - Interdisciplinary field drawing on linguistics, machine learning, computer science, etc. innovating methods in analysing natural language.
    - NLP models used in social sciences tend to be more descriptive than generative.
- Considerations about language as a data source
    - The language generating process (i.e. the generative model)
    - Sources of variance within the language generating process
    - Complex information structures within language
        - Simplistically, automatons
- Computational Representations of Language
    - Word-frequency approaches
        - Bag of Words
        - _tf-idf_
