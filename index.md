# Introduction to Python for Social Science

This is an work-in-progress website to accompany the optional Introduction to Python for Social Science held at the DPIR in Hilary Term 2020. I aim to keep all slides, exercises, and other supplementary materials on this website.

# Course Details

The lectures will be held weekly on Wednesdays, from 4:15pm to 7:15pm at the IT Lab in the Manor Road Building.

You can find a syllabus for the course [here](/dpir-intro-python/syllabus.pdf).

**Please install the relevant software prior to coming to the first class. Instructions for installation can be found [here](/dpir-intro-python/InstallationGuide.pdf).**

# Lecture Slides

I'm experimenting with [`reveal.js`](https://revealjs.com/#/) for the lecture slides. Links to the lectures are provided below, and will be made available as the lectures are completed. Slides will also be made available in `pdf` (beamer) format.

Please be aware, lectures will be updated continuously, and may contain errors.

#### About Me

My name is Musashi Harukawa, I am a DPhil Politics student at the University of Oxford. Prior to the DPhil (and the MSc in Politics Research the year prior), I worked as a data scientist for a financial conglomerate in Tokyo. Before that, I worked as a teacher in Tokyo and Moscow.

My research interests fall into two areas: computational methods, and the use of personal data for microtargeting by political campaigns. On the methods side, I work mostly on natural language processing, especially word and document embedding models and their use in ensemble approaches. My current project is improving unsupervised methods for measuring the similarity of presented positions held by legislators based on their communication strategies.

I use python and `R` as a regular part of my work, and am a big advocate of more social scientists learning to leverage these techniques.
